I have previous coding experience with developing web apps, typically just games for my cousins. This gave me experience with HTML and CSS. I basically used another file I had already written and then removed or edited all the button to mimic the Path@Penn opener. I coded the static opening page with colors and widths I chose. I then used AI for colors, and retemplated some of the blocks, and then I went back adjusted and tinkered with sizing and coloring with their hex codes.
